Haskell module which implements Euler's Formula.
================================================

This package implements a Haskell module which in turn implements Eulers's formula.

The file which implements this module is a Haskell source code (.hs) file which is called;

>  ./src/EulersFormula.hs

In addition to this file, this package also implements another Haskell source code file which is
called;

>  ./src/testEulersFormula.hs

This file contains Haskell source code which is used to test the module.


&bull; Compiling the Haskell module.
------------------------------

This section assumes that the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) will be used to compile and link the
Haskell source code.

To compile just the source code which implements the Haskell module, invoke the following command
from the command line;

>  ghc -i ./src/EulersFormula.hs
