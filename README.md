# HaskellEulersFormula

Haskell module which implements Euler's Formula.
================================================

This package implements a Haskell module which in turn implements Eulers's formula.

The file which implements this module is a Haskell source code (.hs) file which is called;

  ./src/EulersFormula.hs

In addition to this file, this package also implements another Haskell source code file which is
called;

  ./src/testEulersFormula.hs

This file contains Haskell source code which is used to test the module.
